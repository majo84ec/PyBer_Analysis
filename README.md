# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Pyber is a ridesharing app company who request an analysis on data in some very large CSV files that includes a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This information will help them to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results:

Pyber divided the city in three areas: Urban, Suburban and Rural. The number total of rides was 2375 and 1625 are from the Urban area, this value represents 68,4% of rides in the period of analysis .Therefore, this area has the biggest number of drivers (2405) with a total fare of $39,854.38 and  drivers  received $16.57 when average fare is $24.53. It seems that frequency of rides is high but the distance is short.
On the otherside, the Suburban and Rural Area have higher average rate per ride and driver (see the table below).with low number of rides and drivers. 
In this areas the service is used less frequently however per ride generate more money for the company($10 per ride aprox) and driver makes twice even 3 times more than someone who works in the city.

## Summary:
If the CEO wants to generate more income for the compan inmediatly , he will focus to develop the busissness in the suburban and rural area but with the same number of drivers . Other thing he could do is to generate additional services to create more rides in the city (urban area), like prescription delivery, students rides, etc. Finally, adjust the rate per ride in the differents areas.
